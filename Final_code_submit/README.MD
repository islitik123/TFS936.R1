This repository contains the code for <b> Fuzzy Weighted Progressive Time Contortion (FWPTC) </b>, a method for data augmentaton of timeseries for regression. This is an extension of DTW algorithm using fuzzy sets. The method is applied for <b> EEG based reaction time prediction</b> using deep learning (<b>EEGNet</b>). Reaction time prediction helps to understand brain dynamics and behavior relationship in a <b>driver fatigue prediction</b> task.
